# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview

An introduction to Extract Transform Load (ETL) which is used mainly by data engineers to create data pipelines and automate data. In this project, we will be constructing an automated pipeline that takes in new data from multiple data sources. This pipelines will then perfom requested transformations to the data and make it more readable or useable to the clients/ownwers.

## Resources

  - Data Source: wikipedia-movies.json, movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv
  - Software: Python 3, Anaconda, Conda, Jupyter Notebook, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin 4

# ToDO
  - Write an ETL function to read three data files.
  - Extract and transform data.
  - Load the data to a PostgreSQL Movie Database.

Summary

The ETL performance created to collect and clean information from different sources (Wikipedia JSON and Kaggle and ratings csv files). It then transforms and merges the information and loads it into PostgreSQL dataset tables.
